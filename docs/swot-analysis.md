##  What is a SWOT Analysis?

**SWOT Analysis** is a strategic planning technique used to help organizations or teams identify and understand:

* **S** – Strengths
* **W** – Weaknesses
* **O** – Opportunities
* **T** – Threats

It provides a **structured way to evaluate a project, product, startup, or business idea**, so you can make smarter decisions about how to build, improve, or market it.
