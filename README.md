#  NetGuard Pro – Advanced Network & Security Toolkit

### Created by: Mostafa Essam Abdullah Shehata  
 Mobile Application |  Future Desktop Version Planned  
 All-in-One Network Scanner | Sniffer | Vulnerability Analyzer | AI-Powered Threat Detection

---

##  Overview

**NetGuard Pro** is a **modern, powerful mobile application** designed for **cybersecurity experts, IT admins, ethical hackers, and network engineers**.  
This project aims to **build a full security toolkit from scratch**—starting with **UI/UX design, architecture diagrams, and planning**, all the way to **implementation, testing, deployment, and documentation**.

---

##  Project Goal

Create a **cross-platform (starting with mobile)** network security tool that is:
-  Easy to use for beginners
-  Fast and reliable for experts
-  Focused on **privacy**, **offline usability**, and **modular design**

##  Platform

- **Mobile First**: Native Android App (Kotlin/Java with Jetpack Compose or Flutter)
- **Backend**: Custom business logic (sockets, Libpcap), with optional cloud components
- **AI Engine**: TensorFlow Lite or ONNX Runtime (for local inference)
- **Database**: SQLite for local storage, Firebase for sync
- **API Integration**: NVD, AlienVault, (possibly Shodan in future)
